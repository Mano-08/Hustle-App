# Hustle App

## Inspiration

We all come across cool ideas which can bring about a change and make life easy but it eventually dies when we fail to collect investments. And for that reason we are building **HUSTLE**, that can bring you investments that _You deserve_.

## What it does

**Hustle** enables you to post your ideas, get upvotes for your ideas, get investors and follow people with great ideas.

## How we built it

Everyone in our team wore _multiple hats_. We all collaborated together and coded in different branches and merged them at the end.

## Challenges we ran into

Building APIs was a pretty new concept for the team members. We ran into errors while merging the frontend with the backend.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our strong collaboration and teamwork that made it possible to complete the project on time. We worked on different stacks and learnt a lot along the journey. 

## What we learned

We learnt to deploy API using Postman and also learnt to build a full stack application. Collaboration is a very important aspect and we learnt it while working as a team together. It reminded us of the quote **"Collaboration First Code Second"**-_by Eddie Jaoude_.
